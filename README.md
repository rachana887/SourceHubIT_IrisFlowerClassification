# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification (Machine Learning Project)

## 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species—**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**—based on their **sepal** and **petal** dimensions. It serves as an introduction to supervised learning and classification algorithms using Python.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a classifier that predicts the species of an iris flower given its measurements:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Run the notebook:
Open `iris_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run all cells.

## 📊 Results
- High accuracy using Random Forest Classifier
- Visualized feature relationships using Seaborn Pairplot
- Predicted species from new input data
